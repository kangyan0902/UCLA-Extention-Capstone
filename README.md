## Introduction
The project is mainly focusing on finding a way to distinguish good or bad students. In order to do so, we used k-means clustering as an approach to solve this sepcific request from our clients.

## Methodology
We were provided with more than 20 files of datasets that are uncleaned and disorganized. We had to clean through each datasets and aggregate them as one neated dataset that we can apply our model into. We saved an amount of variables clients desired which contribute to what make a good student. Then we applied k-mean clustering to the final cleaned dataset. Differenes between two clusters are detailed in the final report.
